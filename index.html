    <p>This is a website created for <span class="makebold">project0</span> from <span class="makebold">CS50W</span>
      course. This site is created by me <span class="makebold">Charan V</span> who is pursuing Bachelors in <span class="makebold">ECE</span>.
      I always had a passion about technology. Hence I took the Web Development course from EDX designed by Harvard own
      CS50 by Mr.David Malan. I have browsed for online courses in many sites for web development
      and many more. None had challenging projects like CS50W. So I stuck with this for
      my career development. After the completion of the course I have planned to practice
      development along with learning <span class="makebold">Linux administration</span> and <span class="makebold">AWS</span>.
      As I don't have much to say about me I took a different topic for the project which will be on <span class="makebold">trending technologies</span>
      in the computer science field right now. The topics I mentioned are <span class="makebold">Artificial Intelligence</span>,
      <span class="makebold">Internet of Things</span>, <span class="makebold">Web Development</span>, <span class="makebold">Cyber
        Security</span>. These are one of many trending topics and also popular ones too.<br><br><br><br><br>

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence is an approach to make a computer, a robot, or a product to think how smart human think. AI is a study of how human brain think,
      learn, decide and work,when it tries to solve problems. And finally this study outputs intelligent software systems.The aim of AI is to improve computer
      functions which are related to human knowledge, for example, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.
      <br><br>The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of
      <ul>
        <li>Reasoning</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Problem Solving</li>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <li>Linguistic Intelligence</li>

      <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense
      interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services
      and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes are just
      a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established.
      Over 9 billion ‘Things’ (physical objects) are currently connected to the Internet, as of now. In the near future, this number is expected to rise to a whopping
      20 billion.
      <br><br>There are four main components used in IoT:
      <ul>
        <li>Low-power embedded systems</li>
        <li>Cloud computing</li>
        <li>Availability of big data </li>
        <li>Networking connection</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      28 March 2018
      Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
      Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.
      The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side).
      <br><br>Types of developers
      <ol>
        <li>Front-End Developers</li>
        <li>Back-End Developers</li>
        <li>Full Stack Developers</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      Cyber security is important because government, military, corporate, financial, and medical organizations collect, process, and store unprecedented amounts of data on computers and other devices. A significant portion of that data can be
      sensitive information, whether that be intellectual property, financial data, personal information, or other types of data for which unauthorized access or exposure could have negative consequences. Organizations transmit sensitive data across
      networks and to other devices in the course of doing businesses, and cyber security describes the discipline dedicated to protecting that information and the systems used to process or store it. As the volume and sophistication of cyber attacks
      grow, companies and organizations, especially those that are tasked with safeguarding information relating to national security, health, or financial records, need to take steps to protect their sensitive business and personnel information. As
      early as March 2013, the nation’s top intelligence officials cautioned that cyber attacks and digital spying are the top threat to national security, eclipsing even terrorism.
