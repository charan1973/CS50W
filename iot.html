    <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
    <p>
      The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical
      and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs)
      and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer
      interaction.
      A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip
      transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made
      object that can be assigned an IP address and is able to transfer data over a network.<br>
      <h3>How IoT Works</h3>
      <p>
        An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect,
        send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway
        or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with
        other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention,
        although people can interact with the devices -- for instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.
        The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.

    <h3>Why IoT is important</h3>
    <p>
      The internet of things helps people live and work smarter as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes,
      IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their companies’ systems really work, delivering insights into everything from
      the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.
      IoT enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs. It also cuts down on waste and improves service delivery, making it less expensive to manufacture and
      deliver goods as well as offering transparency into customer transactions.<br>
      IoT touches every industry, including healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing. Smart cities help citizens reduce waste and energy consumption and connected sensors
      are even used in farming to help monitor crop and cattle yields and predict growth patterns.
      As such, IoT is one of the most important technologies of everyday life and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses realize the potential of connected devices
      to keep them competitive.

    <h3>Benefits of IoT</h3>
    The internet of things offers a number of benefits to organizations, enabling them to:
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor their overall business processes;</li>
      <li>Improve the customer experience;</li>
      <li>Save time and money;</li>
      <li>Enhance employee productivity;</li>
      <li>Integrate and adapt business models;</li>
      <li>Make better business decisions;</li>
      <li>Generate more revenue.</li>
    </ul>
    IoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses, industries and markets and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies.<br><br>
    <h3>Pros and cons of IoT</h3>
    Some of the advantages of IoT include:
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;</li>
      <li>Improved communication between connected electronic devices;</li>
      <li>Transferring data packets over a connected network saves time and money;</li>
      <li>Automating tasks helps improve the quality of a business’ services and reduces the need for human intervention.</li>
    </ul><br>
    Some disadvantages of IoT include:
    <ul>
      <li>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases;</li>
      <li>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</li>
      <li>If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted;</li>
      <li>Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</li>
