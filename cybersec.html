    <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
    <p>
      Cyber Security refers to the technologies, processes and practices designed to protect networks, devices, app and data from any kind of cyber-attacks. Cyber security may also known as information technology (IT) security.
      Cyber Security is all about protecting your devices and network from unauthorized access or modification. The Internet is not only the chief source of information, but it is also a medium through which people do business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Cybersecurity Definition:</h3>
      Today, people use the Internet to advertise and sell products in various forms, communicate with their customers and retailers, and perform financial transactions. Due to this, hackers and cybercriminals use the internet
      as a tool to spread malware and carry out cyber attacks.
      <b>Cybersecurity</b> aims to protect the computers, networks, and software programs from such cyber attacks. Most of these digital attacks are aimed at accessing, altering, or deleting sensitive information; extorting money from
      victims; or interrupting normal business operations.<br><br>
      <h3>Types of Cybersecurity</h3>
      Cyber Security is classified into the following types:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5>Information Security</h5>
          <p>
            Information security aims to protect the users' private information from unauthorized access, identity theft. It protects the privacy of data and hardware that handle, store and transmit that data. Examples of Information security
            include User Authentication and Cryptography.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Network Security</h5>
          <p>
            Network security aims to protect the usability, integrity, and safety of a network,
            associated components, and data shared over the network. When a network is secured,
            potential threats gets blocked from entering or spreading on that network.Examples
            of Network Security includes Antivirus and Antispyware programs, Firewall that block
            unauthorized access to a network and VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) used for secure remote access.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Application Security</h5>
          <p>
            Application security aims to protect software applications from vulnerabilities that occur due to
            the flaws in application design, development, installation, upgrade or maintenance phases.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Types of Cybersecurity threats</h3>
      There are many different types of cybersecurity threats, some of the most common types of threats are listed below,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h5>Viruses</h5>
          <p>
            Viruses are a type of malware programs that are specially designed to cause damage to the victims' computer.
            Viruses can self-replicate under the right conditions and can infect a computer system without the permission or knowledge of the
            user. It has two major characteristics, the ability to replicate itself and the ability to attach itself to another computer file. A virus has the capability to corrupt files and steal private information like credit card details of the
            user
            and send them back to the hacker.<br>
            Viruses cannot exist on its own, i.e., without a host program; it is usually present as a parasite on another program. Piggybacking on another program allows the virus to trick users into downloading and executing it.
            When a virus-infected program is executed, the virus also gets executed. Once executed, malware virus performs two primary functions simultaneously: Replicate and Infect.
            The virus takes control of the host computer and begins searching for other programs on the same or other disks that are currently uninfected. When it finds one, it then copies itself into the uninfected program.<br>
            After replicating itself into many copies and infecting other uninfected programs, host program returns to its original form. When the host program gets terminated by the user, the virus too will stop replicating. Since all these
            activities
            occur in the background, the user will be completely unaware of the virus.
            Some viruses will remain active in the system memory even after the user terminated the host program. This type of virus will stay in system memory until the computer is turned OFF. The next time the user boots his computer system, he/she
            might unknowingly execute one of the infected applications on the computer.When the virus remains active in the system memory, it may deliver the payload. The payload can be anything from deleting files or slowing down the computer. It
            could
            modify data files, damage or delete data files and programs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Identity Theft</h5>
          <p>
            It is a type of cybersecurity threat which involves the stealing of personal information of the victims from social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, etc. and using that info to build a picture of the victims. If sufficient
            sensitive
            information is gathered it could allow the cybercriminal to pretend as you in some way.
            In some cases, hackers may steal the bank details of the victims and use it for their personal gain.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Password Attacks</h5>
          <p>
            It is a type of cybersecurity threat which involves a hacking attempt by hackers to crack the passwords of the user. With the help of a hacking tool, hackers may enter many passwords a second to crack the victimâ€™s account credentials and
            gain access.
            Hackers may also perform password attacks on a computer login screen to gain access to a victim's computer and the data stored in it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Trojans</h5>
          <p>
            Trojans are a type of malware programs that disguise themselves as harmless or useful software. Trojans can cause a variety of malicious activities on the victims' computer including downloading malicious programs, deleting or stealing
            files and providing
            hackers unauthorized access to the victims' computer.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Ransomware</h5>
          <p>
            Ransomware is a group of malware which locks or encrypts the victim's computer and demands payment for decrypting the computer. The primary motive for all ransomware attacks is always monetary.
            Unlike many other types of cyber attacks, ransomware attacks notify the victim about the exploit, and it also gives instructions on how to recover from it (usually it demands payment for recovery).
            To avoid a crackdown by law enforcement, hackers who are behind the ransomware attacks typically demand payments in virtual currencies, such as the Bitcoins.
            Since ransomware is one of the most prominent and widespread among all other cyber threats, let's have a closer look at how it operates.
            <h5>Ransomware: Infection Mechanism</h5>
              <p>
                Ransomware infects a computer through various means such as through malicious email attachments, malicious links in shady websites. Most ransomware attacks are based on remote desktop protocol and other tactics that don't rely on user interaction.
                Users may inadvertently download ransomware when they visit compromised websites. Ransomware malware can also piggyback on other malicious software applications as a payload. Some ransomware variants are known to spread through email attachments from
                 malicious emails or released by exploit kits onto vulnerable computers.<br>
                 Once the ransomware gets executed, it can change the victim's login credentials, encrypt files and folders on the victim's device, as well as on other connected devices.
                 In the first case scenario (changing the login credentials), ransomware shows a full-screen image or notification on the infected system's screen, which cannot be closed at the user's will. It may also have the instructions on how users can pay for the ransom and get the decryption key.
                 In the second case scenario (encrypting files and folders), the ransomware malware prevents access to valuable files like documents and spreadsheets.
              </p>
            </li>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h3>
      <p>
        The infamous cyber attacks such as the GoldenEye and WannaCry ransomware attacks have crippled several organizations and forced many to shut down their operations. In the wake of these sophisticated cyber attacks and security breaches, cybersecurity has taken the spotlight among organizations of all sizes.
        New variants. New tactics. Cyber threats continue to evolve. Not only have we seen an increase in cyber attacks on businesses and individuals, but the level of sophistication in those cyber attacks have also increased, as well.
        <br>In the years to come, there will be even more advanced cyber attacks using new technologies, victims, and intentions. There will be a dramatic rise in the availability of Ransomware-as-a-Service and Malware-as-a-Service on the dark web. It will allow anyone, no matter their technical knowledge, to easily and quickly initiate a cyber attack.
        Nevertheless, owing to the extent of damages caused by cyber attacks in the past, now there is a much greater awareness about the cyber attacks and the need for better cybersecurity measure among organizations of all types. This will serve as a motivation for cybercriminals to up their game by staging new and more sophisticated attacks in the future.
        Wide-ranging security vulnerabilities, faster and more sophisticated cyber attacks are all making it extremely difficult for security experts to prevent those threats. Thus, there should be a proper cybersecurity plan in place to prevent cyber attacks from causing any damage.
