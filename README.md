# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

# About Site

This is a website created for project0 from CS50W course. This site is created by me Charan V who is pursuing Bachelors in ECE. I always had a passion about technology. Hence I took the Web Development course from EDX designed by Harvard own CS50 by Mr.David Malan. I have browsed for online courses in many sites for web development and many more. None had challenging projects like CS50W. So I stuck with this for my career development. After the completion of the course I have planned to practice development along with learning Linux administration and AWS. As I don't have much to say about me I took a different topic for the project which will be on trending technologies in the computer science field right now. The topics I mentioned are Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Web Development, Cyber Security. These are one of many trending topics and also popular ones too.
